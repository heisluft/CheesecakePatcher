# CheesecakePatcher
---
### A Patching engine for the [Hackathon](https://www.hackathon.com/) game [Cheesecake Adventures](https://github.com/TinyLittleStudio/java-2d-cheesecake-adventures) from [TinyLittleStudio](https://github.com/TinyLittleStudio).
This branch contains the source of the Patch Engine. For the actual injections, patches and deletions refer to the ["patches" branch](https://github.com/heisluft/CheesecakePatcher/tree/patches).

## CheesecakePatcher is abandoned
I decided to abandon CheesecakePatcher. This mainly has three reasons:
1. Cheesecake Adventures is not being developed anymore
2. As the source of Cheesecake Adventures is publicly available, there is no real reason to patch it - You could just fork the original repo
3. I moved on. I created this mainly to see whether I was capable of creating a patch util. And as I right now am focused on new Projects,
development has been stale ever since the three first commits

Feel free to clone this repo and do with it whatever you want to do that does not violate the GPL ;)
